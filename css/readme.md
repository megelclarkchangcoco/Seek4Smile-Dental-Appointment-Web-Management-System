## Notes on Permission to Use CSS Files

You have the flexibility to use either a single `src/css/style.css` file or multiple `src/css/style.css` files in your project. Here are the guidelines for both approaches:

### Using a Single `src/css/style.css` File
- **Simplicity**: Easier to manage and maintain.
- **Performance**: Fewer HTTP requests, which can improve load times.
- **Consistency**: Ensures a uniform style across the entire project.

### Using Multiple `src/css/style.css` Files
- **Modularity**: Allows for separation of styles by component or feature, making it easier to manage large projects.
- **Scalability**: Facilitates collaboration among multiple developers by reducing merge conflicts.
- **Customization**: Enables selective loading of styles for different parts of the project, which can be useful for dynamic or single-page applications.

Feel free to choose the approach that best suits your project's needs.
